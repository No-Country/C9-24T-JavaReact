## General Information
This project was carried out over a period of one month for [_No Country_](https://www.nocountry.tech/perfilesit). Our objective was to develop an application that enables high school students to make purchases at the school cafeteria without having to endure lengthy queues. This can be achieved by allowing students to select items and add them to their cart, place an order, and simply collect it without any hassle. Additionally, this system eliminates the need for cash transactions, provides parents with greater control over their children's consumption habits, and facilitates data collection for the school to analyze consumption patterns and develop strategies to promote healthier lifestyles among students.

## Project Status

Project is _no longer being worked on_ since it was a one month project

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Integration tests
- Unit tests
- The footer in some devices doesn't work properly
- Sometimes the frontend does not show the order number

To do: 
- Implement frontend for administration: full CRUD of product, categories and characteristics. Users registration. Add funds to students. View of orders and the possibility of cancel an order.
- Implement frontend for parents: view students consumitions
- Implement frontend search bar and filtering by characteristics
- Implement creditcard payment
- Allow parents to restrict products for their sons
- Add an option to the admin for making offers
